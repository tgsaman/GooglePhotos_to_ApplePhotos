- Launch Swift cmd currently throws an error. I'm not even sure I can wrap all of this up into an icon or executable... would it even help anyone? I'll need to see. Good practice problem to watch & learn at least

- Legacy GUI has a deprecation warning, probably need to make a separate folder or delete

- Analyze output to determine if writes were clean or systemically threw any cases (manual)

- Develop analytics graphics (adds use cases for free .exe or App Store product if you get that far)

- Misleading duplicate is too liberal, passing exact duplicates often. Exact duplicates still proc, though, so something isn't right with the url parse logic

- Exact duplicates should process exactly once and then all duplicate images should be put in a new folder: "Duplicates" at the runtime root. 

- CSV should write to the runtime root (pick a folder & everything is read & written in that same folder)

- "used metadata" should all be moved to a folder for optional userspace cleanup
